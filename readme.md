Hi Bupd, thanks for starting this out I wish to put each of my learning into this!! 

# Reason:
- The reason why I created this repo is to fulfill my javascript knowledge to the core so that I can be a better JS Developer or Programmer.
- Also I feel the urge to learn this new programming language also I want the world to see my journey of how I am and how fast I am and the most importantly how my skills are growing both technical and soft-skills.
